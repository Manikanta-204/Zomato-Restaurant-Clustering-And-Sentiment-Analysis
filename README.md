# Zomato-Restaurant-Clustering-And-Sentiment-Analysis
Zomato Restaurant Clustering And Sentiment Analysis by using Unsupervised ML
# Problem Statement
Zomato is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants, and also has food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.

India is quite famous for its diverse multi cuisine available in a large number of restaurants and hotel resorts, which is reminiscent of unity in diversity. Restaurant business in India is always evolving. More Indians are warming up to the idea of eating restaurant food whether by dining outside or getting food delivered. The growing number of restaurants in every state of India has been a motivation to inspect the data to get some insights, interesting facts and figures about the Indian food industry in each city. So, this project focuses on analysing the Zomato restaurant data for each city in India.

The Project focuses on Customers and Company, you have to analyze the sentiments of the reviews given by the customer in the data and made some useful conclusion in the form of Visualizations. Also, cluster the zomato restaurants into different segments. The data is vizualized as it becomes easy to analyse data at instant. The Analysis also solves some of the business cases that can directly help the customers finding the Best restaurant in their locality and for the company to grow up and work on the fields they are currently lagging in.

This could help in clustering the restaurants into segments. Also the data has valuable information around cuisine and costing which can be used in cost vs. benefit analysis
# Data Description
Data could be used for sentiment analysis. Also the metadata of reviewers can be used for identifying the critics in the industry.
This project involved analyzing two datasets - restaurant data and reviews data - to gain insights into the restaurant industry and improve their performance.

# Summary
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and merged the datasets to discover interesting insights about the restaurants that could benefit their owners.
Applied feature engineering techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) for text data using TF-IDF to clear and vectorize critics' reviews, and sentiment analysis to extract positive, negative, and neutral sentiments and identify key areas of improvement using negative reviews.
Conducted clustering on restaurant data using cost, rating, and cuisine list as features. Dimensionality reduction using PCA was performed to convert the data to 3 dimensions, and k-means was applied to the 3D PCA data to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Developed five restaurant clusters based on the results: Cafe, Ice Creams and Desserts, International Cuisines, Premium Continental Restaurants, and Local Street/Fast Food.

# Conclusion
Overall, this project involved various data analysis techniques, including NLP, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, to provide insights into the restaurant industry and improve their performance. The resulting clusters could be used to help restaurant owners make data-driven decisions and improve their operations.
